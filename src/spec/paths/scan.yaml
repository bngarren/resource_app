    A user (at a GPS location) scans and receives data about nearby resources and interactables

      A user position (latitude/longitude coordinates) is required to perform the scan.
      This should be in the form of a tuple: [latitude, longitude]
      
      A user property with user data is optional (a scan doesn't have to be performed by an app user per se)

        A successful scan returns metadata and interactables.
        
        Metadata includes where the scan location occurred, timestamp, etc.
        
        Interactables can include resources, machines, etc. Each of which is an object
        that provides info on the position, distance from user, and whether the user can
        interact with it (i.e. is close enough to it)
